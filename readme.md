# BunLabs.NAudio.Flac

This is a fork of a port of the [naudio-flac](https://code.google.com/archive/p/naudio-flac/) library on the now-archived Google Code, by an unknown author and without a license. However, that library is based on [CSCore](https://github.com/filoe/cscore) which is licensed under MS-PL.

This fork also updates the **NAudio.Flac** library to .NET Standard 2.0 and now depends on NAudio.Core 2.0 so it can potentially be used cross-platform.
